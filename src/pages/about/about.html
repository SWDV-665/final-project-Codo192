    Here at codo farm we value our product. Eating farm-fresh produce has a wide variety of health benefits. Local fresh produce can be found at farmer’s markets, roadside farm stands, pick-your-own food farms, you can order online and we delivered it , and through a community supported agriculture programs. The main health benefit of farm-fresh produce is that it’s fresher because it’s picked at its peak ripeness when it’s most nutrient-dense. Compared to commercial farms, there is no artificial air, lights, temperature changes, added chemicals, or long transport time which cause food to lose nutritional value.
